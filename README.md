  Legend has it that in a temple in the Far East, priests are at tempting to move a stack of disks from one peg to 
another. The initial stack had 64 disks threaded onto one peg and arranged from bottom to top by
decreasing size. The priests are at tempting to move the stack from this peg to a second peg under
the constraints that exactly one disk is moved at a time, and at no time may a larger disk be placed
above a smaller disk. A third peg is available for temporarily holding the disks. Supposedly the world
will end when the priests complete their task, so ther e’s little incentive for us to facilitate their ef-
forts.
  Let’s assume that the priests are attempting to move the disks from peg 1 to peg 3. We wish to
develop an algorithm that will print the precise sequence of disk-to-disk peg transfers.
